Depending on the hardware, the inference time may not be accelerated as much as the operation costs reduction.

So please check with the code: Test_your_hardware.ipynb

We strongly recommend using Jetson Nvidia TX2 and Jetson Nano or with hardware of a similar specification.

However, if there is none, please experiment with existing hardware and refer to the result of acceleration indirectly with 'average resolution' in excel.
